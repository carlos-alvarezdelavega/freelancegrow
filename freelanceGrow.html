        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <h3>Apprenticeship Programme</h3>
        <p>
          New freelancers join a paid apprenticeship period, consisting of
          completing three paid projects. This programme helps us assess your
          expertise. Also, it enables you to get familiar with how we operate
          and help you decide if we're the right fit for you.Upon completing the
          apprenticeship programme, you’ll become a member and be assigned to a
          level (see "How we work" below for more details about our levels).
        </p>
        <h3>Bring your reputation from other platforms</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose you have developed a reputation with another freelancing
          platform. In that case, you may be eligible to skip the apprenticeship
          programme and become a member right away. You'll have the option to
          share your other profiles during the sign-up process.

        <h3>Super Peer Support</h3>
        <p>
          Peer support is what makes our platform stand out from the
          competition. Once you become a member, we match you with a Super Peer
          – a freelancer in your field with experience on our platform. Super
          Peers can support you in accessing resources, giving you feedback on
          your portfolio, talking through problems, and many other things! We
          encourage you to set up regular catch-ups with your Super Peer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you gain experience on our platform, you'll have the option to
          become a Super Peer for new members joining us. Being a Super Peer
          benefits you in adding to your professional competencies, accessing
          training sessions, and getting unique badges to display on your
          profile. Further, <b>Super Peers pay lower fees</b> in every
          transaction as active contributors to the community!

          <h2>How we work</h2>
          <p>
            We regulate the market so that
            <b>freelancers don't compete against each other</b> for jobs but
            rather support each other to grow by giving constructive feedback
            and mentoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our level system helps the platform adjust the supply and demand of
            talent, preventing market saturation. New freelancers may have to
            wait until spots are available, but once in,
            <b>chances of landing jobs are much higher</b> than the competition.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col2-top">
          <p>
            We consider three elements for our members to progress through the
            different levels:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>double-blind peer evaluations on project tasks;</li>
            <li>client reviews;</li>
            <li>your Super Peer feedback.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This approach is
            designed for our members to get quality feedback and advance their
            careers.
