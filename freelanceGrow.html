        <h2>A freelancing platform made by freelancers.</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to help you advance your freelance career. We are a
          cooperative – all freelancers have a say on how we operate.
        </p>
        <h3>What differentiates us from other platforms?</h3>
        <p>
          We put people first. At Freelance Grow, we value your work and believe
          that excellent peer support leads to outstanding results. Owned and
          run by freelancers, we attract and develop talent with training,
          benefits, and transparency. Together, we’re constructing the future of
          freelance work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than competing with other freelancers for jobs, our platform
          seeks to establish peer support connections to help each other grow.
          We match clients with talent that meets their project needs so that
          freelancers don't spend endless hours writing proposals and bidding
          for projects. Finally, our members can access unique benefits, such as
          paid time off and reimbursements for their work equipment. Scroll down
          to learn how to get started!

            <li>Tired of applying to hundreds of jobs with no response.</li>
            <li>
              Working on platforms take too much commission for your work and
              tell you virtually nothing about how they operate behind the
              scenes.

            <li>
              Sick of investing too much time developing a reputation that is
              constrained by a specific platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              Anxious about your reputation being ruined by an incompetent
              client.
