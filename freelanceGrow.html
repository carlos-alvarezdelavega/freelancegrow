        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <h3>Apprenticeship Programme</h3>
        <p>
          New freelancers join a paid apprenticeship period, consisting of
          completing three paid projects. This programme helps us assess your
          expertise. Also, it enables you to get familiar with how we operate
          and help you decide if we're the right fit for you.Upon completing the
          apprenticeship programme, you’ll become a member and be assigned to a
          level (see "How we work" below for more details about our levels).
        </p>
        <h3>Bring your reputation from other platforms</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose you have developed a reputation with another freelancing
          platform. In that case, you may be eligible to skip the apprenticeship
          programme and become a member right away. You'll have the option to
          share your other profiles during the sign-up process.

        <h3>Super Peer Support</h3>
        <p>
          Peer support is what makes our platform stand out from the
          competition. Once you become a member, we match you with a Super Peer
          – a freelancer in your field with experience on our platform. Super
          Peers can support you in accessing resources, giving you feedback on
          your portfolio, talking through problems, and many other things! We
          encourage you to set up regular catch-ups with your Super Peer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you gain experience on our platform, you'll have the option to
          become a Super Peer for new members joining us. Being a Super Peer
          benefits you in adding to your professional competencies, accessing
          training sessions, and getting unique badges to display on your
          profile. Further, <b>Super Peers pay lower fees</b> in every
          transaction as active contributors to the community!

          <p>
            We regulate the market so that
            <b>freelancers don't compete against each other</b> for jobs but
            rather support each other to grow by giving constructive feedback
            and mentoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our level system helps the platform adjust the supply and demand of
            talent, preventing market saturation. New freelancers may have to
            wait until spots are available, but once in,
            <b>chances of landing jobs are much higher</b> than the competition.

        </div>
        <div class="col2-top">
          <p>
            We consider three elements for our members to progress through the

          <ol>
            <li>double-blind peer evaluations on project tasks;</li>

            This approach is designed for our members to get quality feedback

        <p>
          At Freelance Grow, we believe that stars and percentages don't make
          justice to your expertise and reputation. Instead, clients leave you
          private constructive feedback to improve your services. You have
          control over what reviews you show on your profile. Most projects get
          evaluated by another freelance peer in your field of expertise. This
          is a double-blind evaluation. Your peer gives you actionable feedback
          to improve your services and hone your skills. These two separate
          evaluations get aggregated and give you points towards our freelancing
          levels.

        <h2>Your reputation travels with you</h2>

          Unlike the competition, we encourage you to export your profile,

          channels. In addition, we offer integration to platforms like LinkedIn
          and Indeed, where you can quickly transfer your experience to
          different career opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have control over what you want to export between your reviews,
          skills, and public projects. Download our reputation reports that you
          can display on your website or integrate with other platforms.

            Buddy works with clients to scope their project needs, short-list

            the art algorithms to help clients define their project needs. Then,
            our systems automatically suggest a small pool of freelancers that
            match the client's requirements. Buddy estimates a fair pay rate for
            the project, which is open for negotiation between the freelancer
            and the client.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buddy uses metrics such as project timeline, expertise level, and
            hours required to match clients with potential freelancers.
