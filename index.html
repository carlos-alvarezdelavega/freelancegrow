            Freelance Grow: A Study about Potential Technologies for Online
            Freelancers
          </h2>
          <p>
            This research study explores online freelancers’ views of fictional
            technology concepts designed to improve the online freelancing work
            experience. In addition, we are interested in exploring how these
            fictional concepts might impact online freelancers’ work and
            identify directions for future technology and policy development. As
            part of the study, we will ask you to engage with our fictional
            concepts and participate in an online focus group to discuss your
            views of these technologies with other online freelancers.

        <h3>1. Recruitment Survey</h3>
        <p>
          In this survey, you will share some details about yourself and your
          online freelancing experience. This survey will determine if you are a
          suitable candidate for participating in this study. The survey takes

        <h3>2. Online Focus Group</h3>
        <p>
          We'll bring together up to five online freelancers to discuss the
          fictional technology concepts via Zoom. We're interested in exploring
          the group's perception of the fictional concepts, how they might be
          used in everyday work, and the implications for the work experience.
          The discussion will conclude with reflections on technology designers
          and policymakers' considerations when supporting the online
          freelancing work experience. The focus group will last up to two hours
          and accommodate various days of the week and times.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Follow-up Survey</h3>
        <p>
          One week after the focus group, you will receive a follow-up survey.
          This survey will ask for further thoughts you might have about our
          fictional technologies. In addition, this survey allows you to share
          additional reflections that were not discussed at the focus group.
        </p>
        <h3>Compensation</h3>
        <p>
          Upon attending the online focus group, you will receive an Amazon
          voucher worth £30 as compensation for your time.
